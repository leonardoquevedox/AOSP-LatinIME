> This requires tens of gigabytes of disk space and takes couple hours to complete.
> The aim of this project is to allow development of LatingIME using Android Studio, Android SDK and NDK.

## 🚦 Current status

This is still a work in progress. Currently building the Java part of the app works fine
but you still need to build native libraries separately or extract them from existing APK.
Building host tools (used to generate dictionaries) still requires some more work.
